The devradar represents skills as so called **blips** that are either rendered on a radar-like graph or in a list.

## Radar View

The first one is the **radar** view that shows you all skills oriented in a polar coordinate system with `four quadrants`.
Individual skills in the radar view are shown as circular **blips** (C) with a numeric _ID_ and colored by their respective quadrant (A).
Each quadrant represents a certain group of skills, classical quadrants are _techniques, tools, frameworks (and languages), platforms_.
The distance from blip to the radar center indicates the `adoption level` (B) for a certain skill.
In addition to the center radar graph all skills are listed by name and their respective ID in the corresponding quadrant (C).

The **radar** view is best used to get an overview of the current state of competence.

## List View

The second view is a **list** of all skills in form of individual cards (A).
All skills are listed alphabetically with their `quadrant` and `adoption level` being of secondary relevance.
This information can be found in the _top right corner_ of each skill card (B).

With the **list** view you can get insights into the history of a specific skill e.g. how did it evolve over time, when was a certain tool used for the first time.
