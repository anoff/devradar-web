title: Tracking blip changes (blip history)
weight: 3
---

One crucial element when it comes to skill management is seeing how a certain skill evolves over time.
To support this devradar allows you to build a **history** for each blip.
This history starts with creating the blip for the first time.
A new history entry can be created from the **List view** by clicking the add button on a specific blip card.

Each entry in a blips history has three elements:

1. **Date**: date of the skill change
1. **State**: the blip state at this date
1. **Reason for change**: what lead to the specific change in blip state
