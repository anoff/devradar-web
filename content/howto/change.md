There are two ways to changing content after it has been saved.
Via the UI in **List View** and via the **Settings** tab.

The **Settings** also allow modifying a devradar instance `quadrant` and `adoption level`.

# Change via Settings

Within the settings tab you can edit your devradar in `TOML` format.
Here you can also **import** and **export** your devradar content as a file.

Although the settings view is not intended for it, you can also use it to quick fix issues with your blips.

> Remember to hit **Save** when changing or importing anything

# Change via UI

From the List view you can easily change a specific blip by hitting the edit button on a blip card.
This allows you to change a blips base attributes and delete individual history entries.
Modifying history entries is currently only possible via the settings tab (see above).
